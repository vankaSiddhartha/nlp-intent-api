Hey friends!

I created a cool new website called intrvuAi that lets you practice job interviews for free with an AI agent. You can do mock video interviews, get personalized feedback from the AI on your performance, and even get your resume reviewed.

It's an awesome way to prep for real interviews in a low-pressure environment. If you're a student getting ready to apply for jobs/internships, definitely check it out at intrvuAi.com!

Let me know if you have any questions. I'm happy to help you get started with it.
